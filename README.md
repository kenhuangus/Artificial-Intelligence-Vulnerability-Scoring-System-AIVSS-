# Artificial Intelligence Vulnerability Scoring System (AIVSS) v0.1 #

## 1. Introduction ##

The Artificial Intelligence Vulnerability Scoring System (AIVSS) version 0.1 provides a standardized, comprehensive framework for evaluating and quantifying the security risks associated with AI systems. This framework focuses particularly on Large Language Models (LLMs) and cloud-based deployments, while remaining applicable to a wide range of AI systems. AIVSS v1.0 adapts traditional security vulnerability scoring concepts to the unique characteristics and challenges of AI, drawing insights from leading AI threat taxonomies and security standards. This document outlines the AIVSS framework, including detailed scoring rubrics, an implementation checklist, and considerations for environmental factors.

## 2. The Need for AIVSS ##

Traditional vulnerability scoring systems, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), are insufficient for addressing the unique security challenges posed by AI systems. These challenges include:

*   **Adversarial Attacks:** AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs, a threat not adequately captured by traditional systems.
*   **Model Degradation:**  AI models can degrade over time due to concept drift or data poisoning, impacting their accuracy and reliability.
*   **Lifecycle Vulnerabilities:** AI systems have complex lifecycles, from data collection and training to deployment and maintenance, each stage introducing potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Ethical and Societal Impacts:** AI systems can have significant ethical and societal implications, such as bias and discrimination, which are not considered in traditional security assessments.
*   **Dynamic Nature of AI:** AI systems are often dynamic and adaptive, making static scoring methods less effective.

AIVSS v1.0 addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive framework tailored to the specific security risks of AI.

## 3. Framework Components ##

```

*   **w₁, w₂, w₃:** Weights assigned to each component (Modified Base, AI-Specific, Impact). Suggested starting point: w₁ = 0.3, w₂ = 0.5, w₃ = 0.2 (giving more weight to AI-specific risks). Adjust based on the specific AI system and its risk profile.
*   **TemporalMetrics:** Adjustments based on exploitability, remediation level, and report confidence (similar to CVSS Temporal Score).
    *   **Exploitability (E):**
        *   Not Defined (ND): 1.0
        *   Unproven (U): 0.9
        *   Proof-of-Concept (P): 0.95
        *   Functional (F): 1.0
        *   High (H): 1.0

*   **MitigationMultiplier:** A factor (ranging from 1.0 to 1.5) that *increases* the score based on the *lack* of effective mitigations. 1.0 = Strong Mitigation; 1.5 = No/Weak Mitigation.

## 6. Component Calculations ##

**1. Modified Base Metrics**

```
ModifiedBaseScore = min(10, [MAV × MAC × MPR × MUI × MS] × ScopeMultiplier)
```
Where the Modified Base Metrics (MAV, MAC, MPR, MUI, MS) are derived from the Base Metrics, adjusted according to the specific environment and using the Environmental Metrics. Each Modified Base Metric can be rated the same way as the Base Metrics, with the addition of:

*   Not Defined (X): Uses the unmodified Base Metric value.

**2. AI-Specific Metrics**

```
AISpecificMetrics = [MR × DS × EI × DC × AD × AA × LL × GV × CS] × ModelComplexityMultiplier
```

*   Each metric (MR, DS, EI, DC, AD, AA, LL, GV, CS) is scored from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the severity of the vulnerability in each sub-category, using the detailed scoring rubric provided above (higher score = more severe issue).
*   **ModelComplexityMultiplier:** A factor (1.0 to 1.5) to account for the increased attack surface and complexity of more advanced models.

**3. Impact Metrics**

```
ImpactMetrics = (C + I + A + SI) / 4
```

*   **C (Confidentiality Impact):** Impact on data confidentiality.
*   **I (Integrity Impact):** Impact on data and system integrity.
*   **A (Availability Impact):** Impact on system availability.
*   **SI (Societal Impact):** Broader societal harms (e.g., discrimination, manipulation). Informed by the EI (Ethical Implications) sub-categories.

**Severity Levels (for C, I, A, SI):**

*   None: 0.0
*   Low: 0.22
*   Medium: 0.55
*   High: 0.85
*   Critical: 1.0

**4. Environmental Score**

The Environmental Score is calculated by modifying the Base Score with the Environmental metrics. The formula integrates these considerations:

```
EnvironmentalScore = [(ModifiedBaseScore + (Environmental Component)) × TemporalMetrics] × (1 + EnvironmentalMultiplier)
```

Environmental Component is derived from the AI-Specific Metrics, adjusted based on the environmental context:

```
EnvironmentalComponent = [CR × IR × AR × SIR] × AISpecificMetrics
```

Where:

*   CR, IR, AR, SIR are the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Societal Impact Requirements, respectively.
*   EnvironmentalMultiplier adjusts the score based on specific environmental factors not covered by CR, IR, AR, SIR.

**Risk Categories**

```
Critical: 9.0 - 10.0
High:     7.0 - 8.9
Medium:   4.0 - 6.9
Low:      0.1 - 3.9
None:     0.0
```

}

# Adjust Base Metrics according to environment
vulnerability['modified_attack_vector'] = vulnerability['attack_vector'] # No change
vulnerability['modified_attack_complexity'] = vulnerability['attack_complexity'] * 0.5 # Example: Lower complexity in this environment
vulnerability['modified_privileges_required'] = vulnerability['privileges_required'] # No change
vulnerability['modified_user_interaction'] = vulnerability['user_interaction'] # No change
vulnerability['modified_scope'] = vulnerability['scope'] # No change

# Calculate score (simplified and illustrative)

# Modified Base Metrics
modified_base_score = min(10, vulnerability['modified_attack_vector'] * vulnerability['modified_attack_complexity'] * vulnerability['modified_privileges_required'] * vulnerability['modified_user_interaction'] * vulnerability['modified_scope']) # = 0.098

# AI-Specific Metrics - Example calculations (using average for simplicity):
mr_score = (vulnerability['model_robustness']['evasion_resistance'] +
            vulnerability['model_robustness']['gradient_masking']) / 2  # = 0.75
ds_score = (vulnerability['data_sensitivity']['data_confidentiality'] +
            vulnerability['data_sensitivity']['data_integrity']) / 2  # = 0.8
ei_score = (vulnerability['ethical_impact']['bias_discrimination'] +
            vulnerability['ethical_impact']['transparency_explainability']) / 2  # = 0.75

# Cloud Security (CS) - using the detailed rubric and averaging:
cs_score = (vulnerability['cloud_security']['model_manipulation'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['data_poisoning'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['sensitive_data_disclosure'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['model_stealing'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['failure_malfunctioning'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['insecure_supply_chain'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['insecure_apps_plugins'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['denial_of_service'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['loss_of_governance_compliance']) / 9 # = 0.64

# Assume other AI-specific metrics are calculated and we have these scores (Illustrative):
dc_score = 0.7
ad_score = 0.55
aa_score = 0.6
ll_score = 0.75
gv_score = 0.8

# Calculate the overall AI-Specific Metrics score:
ais_score = (mr_score * ds_score * ei_score * dc_score * ad_score * aa_score * ll_score * gv_score * cs_score) * vulnerability['model_complexity_multiplier'] # = 0.095

# Impact Metrics
impact_score = (vulnerability['confidentiality_impact'] + vulnerability['integrity_impact'] + vulnerability['availability_impact'] + vulnerability['societal_impact']) / 4 # = 0.543

# Temporal Metrics - using average for simplicity:
temporal_score = (vulnerability['temporal_metrics']['exploitability'] +
                  vulnerability['temporal_metrics']['remediation_level'] +
                  vulnerability['temporal_metrics']['report_confidence']) / 3  # = 0.97

# Environmental Component
environmental_component = (vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['cr'] * vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['ir'] * vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['ar'] * vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['sir']) * ais_score # = 0.072
# Environmental Score
environmental_score = min(10, ((modified_base_score + environmental_component) * temporal_score) * vulnerability['mitigation_multiplier']) # = 0.232

# Final AIVSS Score
final_score = ((0.3 * modified_base_score) + (0.5 * ais_score) + (0.2 * impact_score)) * temporal_score * vulnerability['mitigation_multiplier'] # = 0.323
```

**Interpretation of the Example:**

In this example, the final AIVSS score is approximately **0.323**, which falls into the **Low** risk category. The Environmental Score is factored in, slightly modifying the Base Score based on the specific environmental requirements.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Illustrative:** This is a simplified example. Real-world assessments will involve a more thorough evaluation of each sub-category.
*   **Weighting:** The weights (w₁, w₂, w₃) can significantly influence the final score. Organizations should carefully consider the appropriate weights based on their specific risk profiles.
*   **Context:** The interpretation of the AIVSS score should always be done in the context of the specific AI system, its intended use, and the potential consequences of a security incident.

## 10. Reporting and Communication: ##

*   **Assessment Report:** A comprehensive report should be generated, including:
    *   A summary of the AI system being assessed.
    *   The final AIVSS score and risk category.
    *   Detailed scores for each metric and sub-category.
    *   Justification for the assigned scores, referencing the scoring rubric and evidence gathered.
    *   An analysis of the key vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
    *   Recommendations for mitigation, prioritized based on the severity of the vulnerabilities.
    *   Appendices with supporting documentation (e.g., threat models, assessment data).
*   **Communication:** Assessment findings should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, including:
    *   **Technical Teams:** To inform remediation efforts.
    *   **Management:** To support risk management decisions.
    *   **Board of Directors:** To provide an overview of the organization's AI security posture.

## 11. Integration with Risk Management Frameworks: ##

*   **Mapping:** AIVSS metrics can be mapped to existing risk categories within organizational risk management frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001).
*   **Risk Assessments:** AIVSS assessments can be incorporated into broader risk assessments.
*   **Audits:** AIVSS can be used as a framework for conducting audits of AI systems.

## 13. Continuous Improvement ##

This AIVSS framework should be treated as a living document. This is version 0.1 and it will be revised and updated. Organizations are encouraged to provide feedback, contribute to its development, and adapt it to their specific needs. Regular updates will be released to incorporate new research, threat intelligence, and best practices.

## 14. Conclusion ##

The AIVSS framework version 0.1 provides a structured and comprehensive approach to assessing and quantifying the security risks of AI systems. By using this framework, along with the provided checklist, organizations can gain a better understanding of their AI-specific vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation efforts, and improve their overall AI security posture. The detailed scoring rubric, the inclusion of relevant AI threat taxonomies, the addition of the Environmental Score, and the focus on practical implementation make AIVSS a valuable tool for securing the future of AI. Continuous improvement, community engagement, and adaptation to the evolving threat landscape will be crucial for the long-term success and adoption of AIVSS.

**Disclaimer:**

AIVSS is a framework for assessing and scoring the security risks of AI systems. It is not a guarantee of security, and it should not be used as the sole basis for making security decisions. Organizations should use AIVSS in conjunction with other security best practices and should always exercise their own judgment when assessing and mitigating AI security risks.
