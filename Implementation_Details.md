### Instructions
- Run the Python file from your terminal using python aivss_calculatorV1/V2.py
- Provide the appropriate values for each parameter being assessed
- This will print the calculated AIVSS score to the console.

### Note
This code provides a basic implementation of the AIVSS framework. You can further customize it by:
- Creating a user interface for easier input and output
- Integrating the code with other security tools.

### V2 Updates
Key changes:
- Updated parameter values: The scoring rubric for each parameter (AV, AC, PR, etc.) has been updated to match the values in the GitHub repository.
- New parameter value dictionaries: Dictionaries for the new AI-specific metrics (MR, DS, EI, DC, AD) have been added with their corresponding values and descriptions.
- Updated weights: The weights assigned to the base metrics (w1), AI-specific metrics (w2), and impact metrics (w3) have been updated to 0.25, 0.45, and 0.30, respectively, as per the new scoring methodology.
- Interactive input for all parameters: The code now prompts the user to select values for all parameters, including the AI-specific metrics, using the get_user_input function.
