##Instructions:

1.Run the Python file from your terminal using python aivss_calculator.py.
2.Provide the appropriate values for each parameter being assessed.
3.The user can easily assess different vulnerabilities by providing inputs through a series of command-line prompts
4.This will print the calculated AIVSS score to the console.

##Note:
This code provides a basic implementation of the AIVSS framework. You can further customize it by:

1.Creating a user interface for easier input and output.
2. Integrating the code with other security tools.
